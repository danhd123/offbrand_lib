/**
 * @addtogroup OBMap
 * @brief Container class that stores an Offbrand compatible class instance
 * using another Offbrand compatible class instance as a key
 *
 * @details An OBMap uses key-value based storage to provide constant lookup,
 * insertion, and removal times. Maps need not contain instances of only one
 * class and should handle any collection of classes used as both keys and
 * values.
 * The OBMap class uses an open addressing collision handling mechanism, which
 * is responsible for a lesser memory overhead compared to separate chaining at
 * the expense of acceptable load factor and O(n) key removal
