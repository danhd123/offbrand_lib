 * THREAD SYNCHRONIZATION LIBRARY

 * The locking methods declared below are intended to benefit the creation
 * of threadsafe classes. These locking methods are called internally in all
 * Offbrand classes. Thread safety is the default on all Offbrand builtins,
 * locking methods do not (and should not) need be called on Offbrand builtins
 * directly. This convention should be followed when creating any Offbrand
 * compatible classes.
 *
 * Methods do nothing but return 0 if OB_THREADED is undefined (threading is not
 * desired) so that program resources are not wasted locking and unlocking objs
 * for the single thread. if OB_THREADED is defined then methods perform 
 * described function*
